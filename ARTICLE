Here the author is giving some idea's, how we can stay connected to each other when we are quarantine. By Planning and bringing the people to the discussion gives some joy. What they need, when they are self-quarantine? Its nothing but a computer or phone with an internet connection.
Party will always makes fun when they have some crazy friends. So prepare a guest list and create a group chat with all of them. As they have many onlie options like Face time,Google hangouts, Skype etc,they can try this before the party to check whether it works well to shun disturbance while having a party.So they tried zoom which worked well,they had to make sure that everyone has the account on zoom and then they started to have fun with their folks. Well how does the party starts without foods.So they all cooked the same dish in their home , an yeah they found who is good at cooking and who is not and mocking each other.when the time is up they planned for the next event. Spending time with loved one will always makes you happy even if they are not around you.
